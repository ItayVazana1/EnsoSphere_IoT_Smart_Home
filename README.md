Welcome to **EnsoSphere** – a holistic Smart Apartment IoT Simulation.  
Inspired by the Zen symbol "Enso" (円相), this project embraces the beauty of simplicity, continuity, and responsiveness in modern living spaces.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Simulate **daily routines** across all four seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn).
- Create a **virtual IoT ecosystem** with sensors, actuators, MQTT communication, and a centralized environment manager.
- Build a dynamic **rule engine** that reacts to sensor data and automates device behavior.
- Provide detailed **technical event logs** for each seasonal routine.
- Support real-time visualization via a **read-only dashboard** (optional).
- Ensure full **modularity**, scalability, and documentation.
