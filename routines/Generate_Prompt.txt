Hello! I need your help creating **three files** for a new character in my EnsoSphere project:

1. **<CHARACTER_NAME>_minimal.xlsx**
   - This is a routine file with 48 half-hour slots (06:00 to 05:30).
   - Columns: "Time", "Autumn", "Winter", "Spring", "Summer".
   - Each cell (besides "Time") should contain **only a single location** (like "LivingRoom", "Kitchen", "Outside", etc.) with **no extra text**.
   - Use English only, no Hebrew or special characters.

2. **<CHARACTER_NAME>_detailed.xlsx**
   - Same 48 time slots and columns, but **each cell can include brief parentheses** describing what happens.
     For example: "Kitchen (coffee)" or "Balcony (light workout)".
   - Still keep columns "Time", "Autumn", "Winter", "Spring", "Summer".
   - Use English only.

3. **<CHARACTER_NAME>.md**
   - A Markdown file containing a short day-in-the-life story for each season (Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer).
   - Base the story on the final schedule from `<CHARACTER_NAME>_detailed.xlsx`.
   - Write a mini-paragraph for each season, going through the time blocks in chronological order, describing the main activities and transitions.

### Please follow these steps:

1. **Ask me the following questions** about this new character:
   - **Name**: What is the character’s name or nickname?
   - **General Lifestyle**: Do they work from home, travel a lot, study, have kids or pets, etc.?
   - **Base Routine**: Describe the typical daily pattern (e.g., waking time, meal times, commute, bedtime).
   - **Seasonal Differences**:
     - **Autumn**: Any special morning/evening changes, activities, or location changes?
     - **Winter**: Are there weather constraints, do they skip exercise, or stay indoors?
     - **Spring**: Maybe it’s identical to base routine or have mild variations.
     - **Summer**: Possibly a day off, more outside errands, or special events.
   - **Location Names**: Do you have a set list of valid rooms (e.g. "LivingRoom", "Kitchen", "Balcony", "ParentsRoom"), or are they free-form?

2. **Wait for me to answer**. Then use my answers to build:
   - `<CHARACTER_NAME>_minimal.xlsx` with only short location labels in each cell.
   - `<CHARACTER_NAME>_detailed.xlsx` including short parentheses to clarify.
   - `<CHARACTER_NAME>.md` containing a story, one mini-paragraph per season, using a chronological timeline from 06:00 to 05:30.

3. **Ensure all code or file outputs** are presented in a way I can copy and paste.
   - For the XLSX creation, you can either output CSV form or show Python code (pandas) that generates the `.xlsx`.
   - For the `.md` story, provide the full Markdown content.

4. **Final request**:
   - Please do not include any Hebrew or special characters.
   - Keep everything in English.
   - If certain hours are not specified, you can fill them in logically.
   - No extra commentary beyond the required steps.

That’s it! Once you have my answers, please produce the three files as described. Thanks!
