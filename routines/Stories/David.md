## 🍂 Autumn

**06:00–06:30**  
David wakes up in the **ParentsRoom**, enjoying a few quiet moments before the household stirs. By 06:30, he’s already **Outside**, perhaps taking in the crisp autumn air or starting a light jog.

**07:00–08:00**  
Still **Outside** at 07:00, David then heads to the **Kitchen** by 07:30. He brews a warm cup of coffee, savoring it as the morning light filters in. At 08:00, he moves to the **Balcony**, possibly for a quick break or to glance at the changing foliage.

**08:30–09:00**  
At 08:30, he’s **Outside** again—maybe walking Luna or running an errand—then hops into the **Car** at 09:00, presumably driving to work.

**09:30–17:30**  
From 09:30 all the way to 17:30, David is at **Work**—a solid eight-hour stretch. He tackles projects, attends meetings, and immerses himself in tasks until the end of the workday.

**18:00–20:00**  
At 18:00, it’s back in the **Car** returning home. By 18:30, he’s in the **Kitchen**—likely dinner prep or a relaxing meal. This continues through 20:00, giving him time to cook, eat, and perhaps chat with family.

**20:30–23:00**  
Next, David’s in the **ParentsRoom** at 20:30—maybe changing into comfortable clothes. At 21:00 and 21:30, he’s **Outside** again, enjoying the cool evening or taking a short walk. He returns to the **Kitchen** at 22:00—perhaps for a snack—then heads to **ParentsRoom** at 22:30 and the **LivingRoom** by 23:00 for a bit of TV or laptop time.

**00:00–05:30**  
Just past midnight, David heads to the **Balcony** for a quick breather before popping into **Bathroom1** at 00:30. By 01:00, he’s settling back in **ParentsRoom**. From 01:30 onward, he remains in ParentsRoom for the rest of the night, getting some well-earned rest until 05:30 the next day.

## ❄️ Winter

**06:00–07:00**  
David starts at **ParentsRoom** at 06:00, still warm under the blankets. Half an hour later, he’s *still* in ParentsRoom—maybe reluctant to face the cold morning. By 07:00, though, he’s in **Bathroom1**—time for a hot shower and a brisk wake‐up.

**07:30–08:30**  
At 07:30, David is in the **Kitchen**, preparing a hot drink to combat the chilly air. By 08:00, he moves onto the **Balcony**—possibly a quick look at the snow or a short exercise session. Ten minutes later, at 08:30, it’s **Car** time: heading to work.

**09:00–17:30**  
From 09:00 onward, David’s day belongs to **Work**. Whether he’s coding, in meetings, or sipping hot tea, the winter workday stretches right through 17:30 with no location change.

**18:00–19:00**  
Come 18:00, David’s in the **Car** again—likely driving home in the early winter darkness. At 18:30, he’s in **Bathroom1**; perhaps a warm shower to thaw out from the commute. By 19:00, he’s moved to the **Kitchen** for dinner.

**19:30–20:30**  
He stays in the Kitchen area through 20:30—cooking, eating, and cleaning up, shielded from the cold outside.

**21:00–22:30**  
At 21:00, David moves to the **Balcony**—light winter training or a breath of crisp air. He sticks around outside through 21:30. By 22:00, he’s back to **Bathroom1**—maybe an evening freshen‐up—then **ParentsRoom** at 22:30 for some relaxation.

**23:00–05:30**  
From 23:00, we see him in the **LivingRoom** for an hour of TV or reading, and then at 00:00 and 00:30, he’s on the **Balcony** and in **Bathroom1** again—final nighttime rituals. By 01:00, it’s back to **ParentsRoom**, where he stays cozy for the rest of this wintry night until 05:30.
